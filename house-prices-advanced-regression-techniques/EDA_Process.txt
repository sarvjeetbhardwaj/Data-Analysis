In Data Analysis we will analyse to find the below stuff

1. Missing values
2. All the Numerical Variables
3.Temporal Variable
4. Distribution of numerial Variables
5. Categorical Variables
6. Outliers
7. Relationship between independent and dependent variables
8. Correlation


Observations ::

In order to fill missing values ,we need to check the relationship between missing independent and dependent variable.

With the relation between the missing values and the dependent variables is clearly visible. So we need to replace these
nan values with somthing meaningful ( not just mean, median or mode ) .

The newer houses have are more costly than the older ones .
